In this study, the authors described and vallidated a system that uses pseudovirus to perform deep mutational scanning on viral glycoproteins. In particular, they mapped monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

Details on each antibody and the structures used for visualizing them can be found [here](/tests/SARS2-Omicron-BA1-DMS/experiments.csv)
